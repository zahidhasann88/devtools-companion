## Installation

To run the DevTools Companion API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zahidhasann88/devtools-companion.git
   cd devtools-companion
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/devtools
   ```

   Adjust `MONGODB_URI` as per your MongoDB setup.

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The API server will start running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints. Make sure to refer to the [Endpoints](#endpoints) section below for detailed information on available routes and their usage.

## Endpoints

### Authentication Routes

- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Log in an existing user.

### JSON Manipulation Routes

- `POST /api/json/flatten`: Flatten a JSON object.
- `POST /api/json/parse`: Parse a JSON string.

### Markdown Rendering Routes

- `POST /api/markdown/render`: Render Markdown to HTML.

### Color Conversion Routes

- `POST /api/color/convert`: Convert color between HEX and RGB formats.

### Regex Validation Routes

- `POST /api/regex/validate`: Validate input against a regular expression.

For detailed request and response formats, refer to each route's respective documentation in the codebase or use tools like Swagger for API documentation.

## Error Handling

The API handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate HTTP status codes along with error messages in JSON format. Middleware functions are used for centralized error handling to ensure consistency.
